let library = [];

function Book() {
    // the constructor...loops through the array to display each book on the page
}

function addBookToLibrary() {
    // do stuff here...
}









// 1. Write a function that loops through the array and displays each book on the page. 
// You can display them in some sort of table, or each on their own “card”. 
// It might help for now to manually add a few books to your array so you can see the display.

// 2. Add a “NEW BOOK” button that brings up a form allowing users to input the details for the new book: 
// author, title, number of pages, whether it’s been read and anything else you might want.

// 3. Add a button on each book’s display to remove the book from the library.
// 3a. You will need to associate your DOM elements with the actual book objects in some way. 
// One easy solution is giving them a data-attribute that corresponds to the index of the library array.

// 4. Add a button on each book’s display to change its read status.
// 4a. To facilitate this you will want to create the function that toggles a book’s read status on your Book prototype instance.
